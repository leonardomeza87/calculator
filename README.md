# Calculator

With this calculator you can solve operations that include addition ➕, subtraction ➖, division ➗, multiplication ✖️ and power 💪 continuously, that is, you can write all that in a row, and see what you write, then hit the equal button and get your result!✔️

You can also solve square roots 🌱 but this mode is not compatible with the other modes, that is, if you enter the root sign you cannot enter the others and vice versa.

All operations support decimals, and display results up to 4 decimal places 👌
